# Packer Build - Ubuntu 18.04 minimal Vagrant Box

install scripts in no particular order, though initialize.sh should be first in those scripts and I think maybe setup-vagrant should be at the end
Note that none of them count against the timeout, since they run after ssh is established

**Current Ubuntu Version Used**: 18.04.4

See the [project README.md](../README.md) for usage instructions.
